# Secret Recipes of the Python Ninja
This is the code repository for [Secret Recipes of the Python Ninja](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/secret-recipes-python-ninja?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788294874), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
You’ll unearth secrets related to the implementation of the standard library, by looking at how modules actually work. You’ll understand the implementation of collections, decimals, and fraction modules. If you haven’t used decorators, coroutines, and generator functions much before, as you make your way through the recipes, you’ll learn what you’ve been missing out on.

We’ll cover internal special methods in detail, so you understand what they are and how they can be used to improve the engineering decisions you make. Next, you’ll explore the CPython interpreter, which is a treasure trove of secret hacks that not many programmers are aware of. We’ll take you through the depths of the PyPy project, where you’ll come across several exciting ways that you can improve speed and concurrency.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 6 doesn't have code files. The code bundle includes all the code even the command and output.

The code will look like the following:
```
def print_funct(arg):
    print(arg)
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import sys
        print_funct(sys.argv[1])
```

Intermediate knowledge of Python is required though many topics are covered in a way that even beginners should have an understanding of the basic principles being covered. Specifically, the experience of using both the interactive Python interpreter and writing Python files, how to import modules, and how to work with object-oriented principles is assumed.
This book uses Python 3.6 for the examples, unless otherwise indicated. While alternative implementations are briefly discussed, the book assumes the basic CPython implementation is being used.
